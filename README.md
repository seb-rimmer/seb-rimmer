- 👋 Hi there, I'm Sebastian! 
-  🧑‍🎓 I’m studying towards an integrated Masters of Aerospace Engineering at The University of Sheffield (UK), graduating 2023
- 🛰️I have a wide range of interests in satellite engineering and learning how to use space as a shared resource for all of humanity 🌍

On my GitHub you can find some of my projects on optimal spaceflight trajectories, astrodynamics, and data structures. When I have the time I enjoy learning new programming skills to help solve problems in space!
